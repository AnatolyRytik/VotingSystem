Description
------------
Task: Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend.

 * 2 types of users: admin and regular users
 * Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
 * Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
 * Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
 * Only one vote counted per user
 * If user votes again the same day:
    - If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
 * Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
